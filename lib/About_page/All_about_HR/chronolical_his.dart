In some ancient Hindu texts, the boundaries of Kurukshetra (the area under Kuru janpada, not just the modern day Kurukshetra city)[13] correspond roughly to the state of Haryana. Thus according to the Taittiriya Aranyaka 5.1.1., the Kurukshetra region is south of Turghna (Srughna/Sugh), north of Khandavprastha forest (Delhi and Mewat region), east of Maru Pradesh (marusthal or desert) and west of Parin.[14] Some of these historic places are included in the 48 Kos Parikrama of Kurukshetra.",
